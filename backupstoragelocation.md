# Backup Storage Location

The following sample GCP `BackupStorageLocation` YAML shows all of the configurable parameters. The items under `spec.config` can be provided as key-value pairs to the `velero install` command's `--backup-location-config` flag -- for example, `kmsKeyName=my-kms-key,serviceAccount=my-service-account,...`.
