# Backup Storage Location

The following sample GCP `BackupStorageLocation` YAML shows all of the configurable parameters. The items under `spec.config` can be provided as key-value pairs to the `velero install` command's `--backup-location-config` flag -- for example, `kmsKeyName=my-kms-key,serviceAccount=my-service-account,...`.

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: BackupStorageLocation

  name: default
  namespace: velero
spec:
  # Name of the object store plugin to use to connect to this location.
  #

  provider: velero.io/gcp

  objectStorage:
    # The bucket in which to store backups.
    #
    # Required.
    bucket: my-bucket

    # The prefix within the bucket under which to store backups.

    #
    # Optional.
    kmsKeyName: projects/my-project/locations/my-location/keyRings/my-keyring/cryptoKeys/my-key

    # service account here if you want to use workload identity instead of providing the key file.
    #

    serviceAccount: my-service-account

    # The preferred credentials to talk to the GCP cloud storage service.
    #
